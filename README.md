# MyPhD
My PhD thesis and auxiliary notebooks. 

Contents of the notebooks here:

[on_squeezing_into_a_tiny_black_hole.nb](on_squeezing_into_a_tiny_black_hole.nb): explanation of the first sentence of my thesis (the one right after the title "Introduction": "â€”If we squeezed ourselves into grains of sand,\[...\]").

"CurvatureData.nb": co
  - Killing equations of Examples 1.2 and 1.8
  - Surface gravity as per Equation 1.5.2 from from Equation 1.3.2
  - Curvature tensors of the Examples of Section 1.5

"KG_equation_in_Schd_like_coordinates.nb": how to obtain Equation (2.2.7) from the Klein-Gordon Equation (2.1.1).

The numerical analysis of the results in the Chapter Applications are in separate repositories, as referenced in the papers.
